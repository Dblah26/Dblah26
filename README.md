Summary (Introduction)
This Python algorithim is used to determine the grade of a student based upon what the class wanted it to be weighted. The contents of the grade include projects, weekly assignments, midterm, and the final. The projects are worth 25% of the grade, weekly assignments are worth 10%, midterm 25%, amd the final is worth 40%.

Anaysis (Requirments)
-Name of student (Bob John)
-ID of student (123456)
-Graded work (Example: Project A 78%)

Your design (Pseudo Code)
float Final_score = 1.00
float project = 0.25
float weekly = 0.1
float midterm = 0.2
float final = 0.4

if{
  print("what is the name of the student")
//pass input as string and store in an array

  print("what is the students ID")
//pass input as int and store in an array

  print("would u like to add another student? y for yes, n for no")
//pass input as string. If y loop again, if no end loop.
}

  Print("How many weekly asignments were assigned?")
//pass input as int. use for length of weekly assinments array and to divide

  Print("How many projects were assigned?")
//pass input as int. use for length of projects array and to divide

for(int weekly_assignments;int i){ //this will loop for the number they entered for weekly assignments.
  print("enter" name "weekly assignment grade")
  pass input into weekly_array as float
}

print(weekly_array) //prints list of students
float final_weekly = (weekly_score = sum of weekly_array / int weekly_assignments)*weekly.

//repeat this process for projects

print("enter mid term score") //pass as midterm_score
float final_midterm =  midterm_score*midterm
// repeat for final

final_grade = final_weekly + final_project + final_midterm + final_final)
if  final_grade >= .90: return "A"
    if  90 > score >= .80: return "B"
    if  80 > score >= .70: return "C"
    if  70 > score >= .60: return "D"
    if  .60 > score: return "F"
